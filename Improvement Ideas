FUNCTION

Make form field requirement note not pop up when using reset button.

Could add something to mark as reviews having been read by user, but then notification if one has been added (but individuals would each need their own account?)

Would be super cool to be able to visually turn the card around and be able to watch the trailer on the back.  

Once upon opening, have a movie reel roll across header (lightly in the background) and leave a strip of movie reel in its path.  
Even then maybe the reel does a circle or two and then it stops and a gavel appears or maybe the whole thing fades away???


STYLING

On main movie component, set apart the average rating and the 5.0 so one is bolder or size is differnt (like on WDS budgeting app tutorial)

Make mini-gavel slowly bang down beginning when someone clicks on "No Reviews"

Row with Year, Rating and Minutes - Have margin adjustments to make look better.

Make Title Smaller if it is going to go onto two lines (or bigger for one line:))

Change the "view Description/reel" image.

Change description exit button to an x image.
